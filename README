A simple web proxy that removes 4oD's video ads.

Be warned that it is a primitive and quite slow proxy. On slow computers or slow connections it could cause the main video to stutter. I'd only use it when viewing 4oD, personally.

Usage:
 * Install Python - at a guess 2.6+, not 3.
 * Run fourohdee.py
 * Point your browser at localhost:8008
 * Watch stuff on 4oD
 * Ignore most of the errors piping out of the script :)

Developed and tested on Ubuntu with Python 2.7.2. Reported to also work on Windows 7 with Python 2.7.2.

Ideally someone would code up a Firefox/Chrome plugin that does the same job by intercepting requests from the browser directly.

Thanks to Jonas Wagner and his HTTPRipper, on which this code is based.
